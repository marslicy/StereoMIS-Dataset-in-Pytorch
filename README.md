# StereoMIS-Dataset-in-Pytorch

## Download the Dataset

Download the *StereoMIS* dataset from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8154924) and unzip it in the data folder.

Be sure the version is 0.0.1.

Without any preprocessing of the data, you can use the pytorch dataset provided by this repo directly.

## Prepare the Python Environment

I tried to avoid any non-common packages when writing the code.

Create a python environment with

- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- opencv-python`
